# Java basics (Week 1-6)

We will use https://www.javatpoint.com/ as the main tutorial, and possible other sources for specific topics if not covered here.

This tutorial covers a lot of information, and Java basics time is limited to 6 weeks, so we will guide you on what information to learn first.
If there is information that you don't understand, use the search engine to find additional information on that topic. If you still don't understand, ask on the skype group, or other colleagues.
If you find any issues or inconsistencies with the homework, ask on the Skype group, and we will update/correct the text.

### Homework

1. Install Java 11 JDK for your operating system
    * https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html
2. Create your first Java hello world application
    * https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-running-your-first-java-application.html
3. Create a class named \<YourFirstnameLastname\>Week1Homework, and a main method
    * Note: The following exercises will be written inside the main method
4. Define and print on separate lines the following data types, using random values: 
    * Primitive: boolean, char, int, long, double
    * Non primitive: String, array;
5. Define some integer variables. Perform the operations below and print the result
    * increment it using the unary operator
    * perform some random arithmetic operations using the arithmetic operators
    * compare two variables using the comparison operator
6. Define two integer variables, a and b
    * Using an if-else statement, compare the values, and
        * if a is larger, print "\<value of a\> is larger than \<value of b\>"
        * if b is larger, print "\<value of b\> is larger than \<value of a\>"
        * if numbers are equal, print "\<value of a\> is equal to \<value of b\>"
7. Define a number array of 10 elements, using random values from range 1 to 100, which needs to include number 15;
    * Using a for loop, print the values of every element on separate lines. If an element has value 15, skip printing this value.
